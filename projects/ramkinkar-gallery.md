In 1989, Jhargram Art Academy established its very own auditorium, Ramkinkar Mancha.This auditorium is used for multiple purposes from conducting dance classes to hosting the dance shows of the institute, from conducting painting classes to hosting an art exhibition during its annual festival, Rong Mati Manush with the paintings of Art Academy's students and people associated with it, from constructing the puppets to hosting the inaugural shows for every puppet production. Thus this auditoium may be said to be the heart of Jhargram Art Academy since 1989 till date.
