        Amidst the forest of sal tree and red fields of Jhargram was established Jhargram Art Academy,
        which was then named "Rong Tuli". It was established in the year 1980. In the year 1983,
        on 2nd April Jhargram Art Academy came in front of everyone with the name of "Art Academy".
        At the very beginning it was an institute only for the purpose of making everyone familiar
        with the world of art and painting. But today it has now turned out to be a huge institute.
        It has spread its branches in different spheres. Apart from painting, it has started wings
        in dance , drama, puppet, and other cultural activities.
