Amidst the forest of sal tree and red fields of Jhargram was established Jhargram Art Academy,
which was then named "Rong Tuli". It was established in the year 1980. In the year 1983,
on 2nd April Jhargram Art Academy came in front of everyone with the name of "Art Academy".
At the very beginning it was an institute only for the purpose of making everyone familiar
with the world of art and painting. But today it has now turned out to be a huge institute.
It has spread its branches in different spheres. Apart from painting, it has started wings
in dance , drama, puppet, and other cultural activities.<br/><br/>
</p><p>
In 1989, Jhargram Art Academy established its very own auditorium, Ramkinkar Mancha.This
auditorium is used for multiple purposes from conducting dance classes to hosting the dance
shows of the institute, from conducting painting classes to hosting an art exhibition during
its annual festival, Rong Mati Manush with the paintings of Art Academy's students and people
associated with it, from constructing the puppets to hosting the inaugural shows for every
puppet production. Thus this auditoium may be said to be the heart of Jhargram Art Academy
since 1989 till date. In the year 2007, a gallery was opened in remembrance of the great
artist Shri Ramkinkar Baij. This gallery exhibits copies of some of Ramkinkar Baij's oriinal
paintings. It has a pictoral representation of Ramkinkar Baij's life. It is one of the very
few galleries on Ramkinkar Baij.<br/><br/>

To mention in few words, Jhargram Art Academy is a place where you can get a great taste of art
and culture. It has been serving children and rural people through art since last 30 years.
And the man behind all this is everyone's beloved Sanju Da(Sanjib Mitra), and other associates of
Jhargram Art Academy have always been by his side to help this institute become what it is today.
