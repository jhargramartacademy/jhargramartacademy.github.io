Ever since the beginning of Jhargram Art Academy, its main focus has always been art. Art is something whose knowledge is needed to pursue all kind of cultural activities. At the very beginning when Jhargram Art Academy was called Rong Tuli, it was an art school teaching the youth of Jhargram various painting and art skills. Jhargram Art Academy have had students in this branch ranging from the infants to the aged people. The founder of this organization, Mr. Sanjib Mitra is himself an artist who has passed out from Indian College of Art and Draftsmanship and has been teaching painting to the people of Jhargram ever since his stay here. He has always been a great teacher loved by all his students and have always tried to meet the craving for art within the people here.
