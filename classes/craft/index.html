<p>
Since art is the main focus of the institute, we not only teach painting classes but also crafts which is an integral part of art. All the students who are part of the painting classes have crafts taught to them as well. Apart from that, there are weekly craft classes held for elders where various different handicrafts such as mask making, painting, jewellery, etc. are also taught. No skills or prior knowledge of painting is needed in this case. Crafts is a form of expressing the inner artist in you before prior skills of painting and sketching.
<h3>Courses</h3>
<ol>
<li>Craft classes for elders - Every weekend there is scheduled classes for elders focusing more on craft works such as mask making, painting on cloth, jewellery making, doll making, etc.</li>
