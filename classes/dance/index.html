Since 1990, this section of Jhargram Art Academy has been continuously working in the field of dance. Though mainly Kathak is the dance form taught here but other forms of classical dances are also taught with almost equal importance. In our journey we have done dance productions such as Dance With Music, Hingsute Doitto(The Selfish Giant), Alor Pakhi(The Bird of Light) and many more. It has also done dance production on the Africa poem by Rabindranath Tagore with exceptional creativity. Besides teaching dance, we also have exam facilities to test a student's dancing skills. Regularly, examinations on Kathak Dance, Ranbindra Nritya and other forms of dance are held.
<h3>Courses</h3>
<p>The main form of dance taught here is Kathak along with Rabindra Nritya and Bharatnatyam. Facilities for examinations to test the students is also available. There are weekly classes on Tuesday. To register for dance class please contact with Jhargram Art Academy.</p>
<h3>Workshops</h3>
<p>Dance workshops are held during the summer holidays at the time of Sishu Utsav. After extensive workshop on various dance forms, there is a dance show to showcase the result of the workshop at the end of the sishu utsav.</p>
